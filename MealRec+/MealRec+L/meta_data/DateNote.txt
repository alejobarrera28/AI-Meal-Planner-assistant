Course metadata files (course.zip and user_course.zip) have been removed to simplify the dataset and eliminate Git LFS dependency.

The educational demo works with course IDs (Course_54614, Course_19963, etc.) instead of full recipe names, maintaining 100% authenticity while keeping the project lightweight and portable.

All core functionality remains intact:
- Real health scores (FSA/WHO)
- Course categories (appetizer/main/dessert)  
- Meal compositions
- User interaction data
