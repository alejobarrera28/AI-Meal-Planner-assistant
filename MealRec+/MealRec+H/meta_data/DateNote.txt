The educational demo uses course IDs (Course_54614, Course_19963, etc.) to maintain dataset authenticity while keeping the project lightweight and portable.

All core functionality remains intact:
- Real health scores (FSA/WHO)
- Course categories (appetizer/main/dessert)  
- Meal compositions
- User interaction data
